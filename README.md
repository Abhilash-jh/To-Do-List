A simple, minimalistic, and responsive To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery).

🚀 Features

➕ Add new tasks instantly by pressing Enter.
✅ Mark tasks as completed using checkboxes.
❌ Delete tasks with a click.
💾 Persistent storage using localStorage.
🎨 Clean and responsive UI with smooth animations.
